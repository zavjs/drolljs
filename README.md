## Droll - simulated JS automation toolkit (2017)

Droll is meant to simulate automated toolkit functionalities (e.g: Gulp.js), while revisiting concepts such as the Fluent Design Pattern, and Node.js' File System Module.  

See the blog post [here](https://zavjs.github.io/understanding-automated-toolkits)

To try it out, run `node droll.js`.
